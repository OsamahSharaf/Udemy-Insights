Introduction:
Hey everyone! Today, I'm excited to share with you a project I've been working on called "Udemy Insights." This project focuses on analyzing courses on Udemy to gain valuable insights into the platform's courses. 

Phase 1: Data Collection
So, the first step in this project was collecting data from Udemy. Utilizing web scraping techniques, data was gathered from various courses, including details like title, duration, price, subject, and published timestamp. 

Phase 2: Data Preprocessing
Once the data was collected, the next step was preprocessing. This involved cleaning up the data and preparing it for analysis. Additional columns, such as "Duration Category" and "Price Category," were created to categorize the courses based on their duration and price range.

Phase 3: Data Analysis
With the data cleaned and prepared, it was time to dive into the analysis. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis were performed to explore various aspects of the data. This included examining trends over time, relationships between different variables, and identifying any patterns or insights that could be gleaned from the data.

Conclusion:
Overall, Udemy Insights has been a fascinating project to work on. It has provided valuable insights into the Udemy course landscape and has served as a solid foundation for further analysis and exploration. Whether you're interested in data analysis, web scraping, or simply curious about the courses available on Udemy, I hope you find this project as informative and engaging as I did!
